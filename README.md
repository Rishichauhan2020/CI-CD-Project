# GitHub CI & Linting

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically check code for errors with **Super-Linter**.

## What I Did

1. Set up a repository on GitHub.
2. Added **Super-Linter** to automatically check code.
3. Created a **"dev" branch** for development.
4. Conducted a **code review** with a teammate.
